# ReactZenith - Learning React.js, Redux, Hooks, and More
Welcome to ReactZenith, a comprehensive repository where I document my journey of learning and mastering React.js, Redux, Hooks, and other related technologies. As I explore the vast landscape of React development, this repository serves as a centralized hub for all my notes, projects, and code snippets.

# Learning Focus
React.js: Dive into the fundamentals of React.js, mastering the concepts of components, state, props, and more.
Redux: Explore state management with Redux, understanding the principles of actions, reducers, and the Redux store.
